# First group homework!

Due Feb. 22 11:59 PM

In your GitHub repo for your class project, under the docs directory, create a design directory or something similar, put in your use case and component specifications as Markdown files.  You can have images, workflows, interaction diagrams, etc.

Evaluation rubric:
1. Did you put the files in your repo?
2. Did you enumerate all of the use cases?  There should be at least three.
3. Did you identify and design components to support your use cases?
4. Did you try to reuse components?
5. Did you exhaust the list of components to primitive components?
