## Potential Additions to Lecture/HW

* Add in information about storing images? Calculate how much space a certain type of image would take up. If it was binary. If it was float. If it was uint8. If it was RGB. (Reference my old textbook potentially)

* I really like the bad figures idea. Great exercise here. Maybe add in some bad examples from Excel, since many an undergrad paper was done with Excel. Maybe open Excel during the lecture to demo how bad the default behavior is?

* Maybe talk about the ills of using pie charts?

* What happens when your colors are too similar that you can't distinguish them?
* Add in a plug for viridis and perceptually uniform colormaps

* Using colors: distinguishing between groups versus representing a continuous variable. Categorical or continuous.
